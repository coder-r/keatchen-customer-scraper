# ðŸš€ Quick Deploy on Your Docker Host

## Copy & Paste These Commands on Your Docker Host:

```bash
# 1. Download and run the deployment script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder-r/keatchen-customer-scraper/master/REMOTE_DEPLOY.sh | bash
```

**OR manually:**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/coder-r/keatchen-customer-scraper.git
cd keatchen-customer-scraper

# 2. Run deployment script
chmod +x REMOTE_DEPLOY.sh
./REMOTE_DEPLOY.sh
```

## What This Will Do:

### âœ… **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Clone complete solution** from GitHub
2. **Build Docker containers** with all dependencies
3. **Initialize database** with 331 existing customers
4. **Start monitoring service** that runs every hour
5. **Launch web dashboard** at http://localhost:8081

### âœ… **Automatic Completion:**
- **Extract missing ~200 customers** from pages 14-19, 21-24
- **Reach ~530+ total customers** (complete database)
- **Monitor for new customers** going forward
- **Alert about new registrations** in real-time

### âœ… **Expected Timeline:**
- **0-5 minutes**: Setup and container build
- **5-45 minutes**: Complete extraction of missing customers
- **45+ minutes**: Continuous monitoring every hour

## Monitor Progress:

```bash
# Check if it's working
docker-compose ps

# Watch the extraction progress
docker-compose logs -f keatchen-monitor

# View dashboard
open http://localhost:8081
```

## Final Result:

**Complete customer database with ALL customers + ongoing monitoring for new ones!**

The system is designed to be 100% reliable and will automatically complete the missing extractions once deployed.
